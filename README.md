# Learning With Us

#### LearningWith.Us is my current side project that I am building in Ruby on Rails to help my daughter learn pre-school level topics. 

### Overview:
* Currently have 2 learning topics, colors and numbers.
* I'm working on building out separate learning sections with videos to compliment the practice sections currently available.
* I also want to add letters and may extend it to other age groups beyond pre-school level with words and math.
